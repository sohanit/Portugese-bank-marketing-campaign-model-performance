# Portuguese Banking Institution Marketing Campaign Model Performance

## Project Description
The data is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit (variable y).

### Dataset Characteristics
- **Type**: Multivariate
- **Subject Area**: Business
- **Associated Tasks**: Classification
- **Feature Type**: Categorical, Integer
- **# Instances**: 45,211
- **# Features**: 16

### Goal
The goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines) encountered in this section of the program.
